# Berkeley_Pacman_Project
Implementation of Berkeley's Pacman Project as a part of Artificial Intelligence course.
## Project 1:
- Pac-Man Project 1, focused on Search Algorithms, modelling Problem States & Heuristic Functions
- DFS
- BFS
- Uniform-Cost Search
- A* Search
- Specific Problem (navigation, travelling salesman) modelling (starting state, goal state check, creating successor states)
- Implementing & Experimenting with Heuristic Functions (admissable, optimal, greedy)

## Project 2:
- Pac-Man Project 2, focused on Multi-Agent Search Algorithms & implementing Evaluation Functions.
- Dummy Reflex Agent
- MiniMax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Expectimax
- Implementing a custom Evaluation Function by experimenting & tuning on the considered parameters and their weights.
